    "This notebook analyzes the results of an experiment on plant growth, where the goal is to compare the dried weight of plants under three conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Control group (`ctrl`)<br>\n",
    "Treatment 1 (`trt1`)<br>\n",
    "Treatment 2 (`trt2`)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset, PlantGrowth, consists of thirty observations with two variables:<br>\n",
    "**weight**: Numeric values representing the dried weight of plants.<br>\n",
    "**group**: A factor variable with three levels (ctrl, trt1, and trt2), indicating the treatment applied.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical tests will be performed, including:\n",
    "**$t$-tests**: To compare the mean weights between specific groups.\n",
    "**ANOVA**: To assess whether significant differences in mean weights exist across all three groups.\n",
    "The analysis is aimed at determining whether the treatment conditions have a significant effect on plant growth compared to the control group.\n",

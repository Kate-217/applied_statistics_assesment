    "\n",
    "Statistical tests will be performed, including:\n",
    "**$t$-tests**: To compare the mean weights between specific groups.\n",
    "**ANOVA**: To assess whether significant differences in mean weights exist across all three groups.\n",
    "The analysis is aimed at determining whether the treatment conditions have a significant effect on plant growth compared to the control group.\n",

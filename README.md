# Applied Statistics
______________________________________
## About This Project
This project explores statistical concepts and hypothesis testing through Python programming. Key tasks include:

* Calculating probabilities using permutations and combinations.
* Analyzing a normal distribution with synthetic data.
* Performing a paired t-test on a real-world dataset of heart rates.
The project demonstrates practical applications of libraries such as **numpy**, **scipy**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn** for statistical analysis and data visualization.
## Use of This Project
This project is designed for anyone interested in learning statistical methods and Python programming.
